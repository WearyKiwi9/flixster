### Notes
A challenge I had while building this app was learning how to push and commit my files to github. The first time, I ended up losing all of my progress so I had to rebuild the app by scratch. Rebuilding the app for a second time, however, gave me an opportunity to fine tune the skills I implemented for this project.
